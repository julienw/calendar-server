# calendar-server

## Prerequisites

Node.js 6+ is required. The server relies on some ES6 subtleties (like destructuring assignments).
We recommend you to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), in order to juggle between many node version. Once you have it, just run:
```sh
nvm use
```

## API

The API root is `/api/v1`. All following routes are relative to this root.

### POST `/login`

This takes 2 parameters: `user`, `password`. The input can be either
`application/json` or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, with the correct
`Content-Type` header.

If successful, this returns a status 200 with a token in a JSON structure:
```json
{ "token": "ouoiudofiu987987djfjoi..." }
```

This token should be passed in all subsequent requests as a header `Authorization`.

This header should read:
```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Any bad credential will return a 401 status.
Any good credential will return a new token.

Parameters:

  from. Default is now.

  Default is 20. Specify 0 to return everything to the end.
